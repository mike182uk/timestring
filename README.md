Parse a human readable time string into a time based value.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save timestring
```

## Usage

### Overview

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '1h 15m'
let time = timestring(str)

console.log(time) // will log 4500
```

**By default the returned time value from `timestring` will be in seconds.**

The time string can contain as many time groups as needed:

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '1d 3h 25m 18s'
let time = timestring(str)

console.log(time) // will log 98718
```

and can be as messy as you like:

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '1 d    3HOurS 25              min         1   8s'
let time = timestring(str)

console.log(time) // will log 98718
```

### Keywords

`timestring` will parse the following keywords into time values:

1. `ms, milli, millisecond, milliseconds` - will parse to milliseconds
2. `s, sec, secs, second, seconds` - will parse to seconds
3. `m, min, mins, minute, minutes` - will parse to minutes
4. `h, hr, hrs, hour, hours` - will parse to hours
5. `d, day, days` - will parse to days
6. `w, week, weeks` - will parse to weeks
7. `mon, mth, mths, month, months` - will parse to months
8. `y, yr, yrs, year, years` - will parse to years

Keywords can be used interchangeably:

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '1day 15h 20minutes 15s'
let time = timestring(str)

console.log(time) // will log 141615
```

### Return Time Value

By default the return time value will be in seconds. This can be changed by passing one of the following strings as an argument to `timestring`:

1. `ms` - Milliseconds
2. `s` - Seconds
3. `m` - Minutes
4. `h` - Hours
5. `d` - Days
6. `w` - Weeks
7. `mth` - Months
8. `y` - Years

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '22h 16m'

let hours = timestring(str, 'h')
let days = timestring(str, 'd')
let weeks = timestring(str, 'w')

console.log(hours) // will log 22.266666666666666
console.log(days) // will log 0.9277777777777778
console.log(weeks) // will log 0.13253968253968254
```

### Optional Configuration

A few assumptions are made by default:

1. There are 24 hours per day
2. There are 7 days per week
3. There are 4 weeks per month
4. There are 12 months per year

These options can be changed by passing an options object as an argument to `timestring`.

The following options are configurable:

1. `hoursPerDay`
2. `daysPerWeek`
3. `weeksPerMonth`
4. `monthsPerYear`

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let str = '1d'
let opts = {
  hoursPerDay: 1
}

let time = timestring(str, 'h', opts)

console.log(time) // will log 1
```

In the example above `hoursPerDay` is being set to `1`. When the time string is being parsed, the return value is being specified as hours. Normally `1d` would parse to `24` hours (as by default there are 24 hours in a day) but because `hoursPerDay` has been set to `1`, `1d` will now only parse to `1` hour.

This would be useful for specific application needs.

*Example  - Employees of my company work 7.5 hours a day, and only work 5 days a week. In my time tracking app, when they type `1d` i want 7.5 hours to be tracked. When they type `1w` i want 5 days to be tracked etc.*

```js
const timestring = require('timestring')

let opts = {
  hoursPerDay: 7.5,
  daysPerWeek: 5
}

let hoursToday = timestring('1d', 'h', opts)
let daysThisWeek = timestring('1w', 'd', opts)

console.log(hoursToday) // will log 7.5
console.log(daysThisWeek) // will log 5
```
